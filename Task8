# VPN Setup & Privacy Task – Windscribe

## Objective
To understand how VPNs protect privacy and secure communication through encryption and tunneling protocols and to gain hands-on experience in VPN usage.

**Tool Used:** Windscribe (Free Tier)  
**Location Connected:** Victoria (Hong Kong)  
**Original IP Location:** Karnataka, India  
**VPN IP Location:** Hong Kong

## Steps Performed
1. I chose **Windscribe** as a trusted free VPN service and created an account.
2. I downloaded and installed the **Windscribe desktop client** on my system.
3. I logged in and connected to a VPN server (**Best Location – Victoria, Hong Kong**).
4. I verified that my IP address changed by visiting **whatismyipaddress.com**:
   - **Before VPN:** IP – `122.172.86.176` (India)
   - **After VPN:** IP – `146.70.250.13` (Hong Kong)
5. I browsed websites successfully to confirm that the traffic was encrypted while the VPN was active.
6. I disconnected the VPN and confirmed my IP returned to the original, verifying that the VPN connection was successful.
7. I researched how VPN encryption works and its privacy protection features, including masking IP, encrypting data, and secure tunneling protocols.
8. I prepared a summary of VPN **benefits** (privacy, security, bypassing geo-restrictions) and **limitations** (reduced speed, not 100% anonymous, some site restrictions).

## VPN Benefits
- Masks real IP address and location.
- Encrypts all internet traffic for privacy.
- Secures browsing on public Wi-Fi networks.
- Helps bypass geo-restrictions.

## VPN Limitations
- Cannot guarantee complete anonymity; the VPN provider can still see activity.
- May reduce internet speed.
- Some websites block VPN IPs.
- Free plans may have data caps.

## Key Concepts Learned
- **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** – A tool that encrypts internet traffic and hides IP addresses.
- **Encryption** – Secures data from interception.
- **Tunneling Protocols** – Methods for securely transmitting data, such as WireGuard and OpenVPN.
- **Privacy Protection** – Using VPNs to safeguard identity and data.

- `after_vpn.png` – After VPN connection (VPN-assigned IP).
